# Lesson 2 ####

# Load tidyverse package
library(tidyverse)

# Load data
data("mpg")

# Check the structure of mpg using str()
str(mpg)

# Answer below (using a comment) what type of data structure mpg is?
# Data Frame

# Create analysis data frame: We do this so we preserve a raw version of the dataframe to which we can refer as we make
mpg_df<-mpg

# Check the structure of mpg_df using str()
str(mpg_df)

# Scatter plot of displ x hwy
ggplot(mpg_df,aes(x=displ , y=hwy ))+
  geom_point()

# Scatter plot of displ x hwy by fuel type (fl)
ggplot(mpg_df,aes(x=displ , y=hwy, color=fl ) )+
  geom_point()

# On Your Own, Scatter plot of displ x hwy by class
ggplot(mpg_df,aes(x=displ , y=hwy, color=class ) )+
  geom_point()

# Lesson 3 ####

?ggplot()

# Call help for filter
?filter()

# Call help for geom_bar()
?geom_bar()

# Call help for facet_wrap()
?facet_wrap()

# ggplot - data layer, assign it to mpg_data
mpg_data<- ggplot(data = mpg)

# Call mpg_data
mpg_data

# Describe the output you see in the console.
# The plot is currently just a grey box with no aesthetics

# Now, let's add an aesthetic layer to the plot.

# Put engine size on the x-axis, highway mileage on y-axis, and color by class.
mpg_plot<-mpg_data + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=displ, y=hwy, color=class))

# Call mpg_plot.
mpg_plot

# What do you see?
# A scatter plot graph organized by displ, hwy mpg, and class of car

# Now, let's add an aesthetic layer to change the axis labels
mpg_axis <- mpg_plot +
  xlab("Engine Size in Liters")+
  ylab("Highway Mileage")+
  ggtitle("Engine Size and Mileage by Vehicle Class")

# Call mpg_axis
mpg_axis

# What do you see?
# The same scatter plot as before but with the new descriptive labels and title

# Create different graphs for each class
mpg_wrap <- mpg_axis +
  facet_wrap(~class, nrow = 2)

# Call mpg_wrap
mpg_wrap

# What do you see?
# The large scatter plot has been separated into 7 plots, with each being their own class of car

# Re-assign mpg_wrap by adding facet wrapping, change nrow to 3.
mpg_wrap <- mpg_axis +
  facet_wrap(~class, nrow = 3)
mpg_wrap

# What do you see?
# Same 7 scatter plots as before but organized in 3 rows on the plots screen

# Interpret this result using a comment your script file.

# Now let's see how it works on a data frame.
