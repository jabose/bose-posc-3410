# Saving Private Ryan

#Lesson 2 ####

# Let's Try Some Basic Arithmetic ####

# Sum of 1 and 1
1+1

# Divide 365 by 12
365/12

# Your turn, multiply 10 by 12
10*12

# Your turn, add 28 + 38
28+38

# Order of Operations in R
1+1*(365/12)

# Multiply 6 by 6
6*6

# Divide 9 by 3.142
9/3.142

# Learning to assign variables ####

#Run this line of code to assign your first variable.
myFirstVar<- "Hello world!"

# Run myFirstVar in the console.
myFirstVar

# Code a second variable with a number.
mySecondVar<-16

# Run mySecondVar in the console.
mySecondVar

# Now let's practice assigning variables.
# Assign "Clemson" to 'home'
home<-"Clemson"

# Assign "Tigers" to 'h_mascot'
h_mascot<-"Tigers"

# Assign "Ohio State" to 'away'
away<-"Ohio State"

# Assign "Buckeyes" to 'a_mascot'
a_mascot<-"Buckeyes"

# Assign 31 to 'homeScore'
homeScore<-31

# Assign 0 to 'awayScore'
awayScore<-0

# Assign TRUE to homeWin
homeWin<-TRUE

# Assign FALSE to awayWin
awayWin<-FALSE

# Use class to identify the data type for the following variables.
class(h_mascot)
class(homeScore)
class(homeWin)

# Use str to identify the data types for the following variables
str(h_mascot)
str(homeScore)
str(homeWin)

# Can sports scores ever be represented as decimals? No. We need to convert the`homeScore`and`awayScore' to integers.

# Convert 'homeScore' to integer and assign to same var name.
homeScore<-as.integer(homeScore)
homeScore

# Now it is your turn

# Convert 'awayScore' to integer and assign to same var name.
awayScore<-as.integer(awayScore)
awayScore

# Make a numeric vector by using the syntax 'c(#,#,#,#)';check its structure.
vector_numeric<-c(12, 8, 16, 4, 15)
str(vector_numeric)

# Make a numeric vector, 'myNumericVector', on your own; check its structure.
myNumericVector<-c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
str(myNumericVector)

# Make a logical vector; check its structure.
vector_logical <-c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, T, F)
str(vector_logical)

# Make a logical vector,`myLogicalVector` on your own; check its structure.
myLogicalVector<-c(F, F, F, T, T)
str(myLogicalVector)

# Make a character vector; check its structure.
vector_character<-c("Montana", "Aikman", "Manning", "Favre", "Mahomes")
str(vector_character)

# Make a character vector,`myCharVector`on your own; check its structure.
myCharVector<-c("Leo", "Josh", "Jed", "Toby", "CJ")
str(myCharVector)

# Make a list of the vectors that I created: drAllardList; check its structure.
drAllardList<-list(vector_numeric, vector_logical, vector_character)
str(drAllardList)

# Make a list of the vectors YOU created: myList; check its structure.
myList<-list(myNumericVector, myLogicalVector, myCharVector)
str(myList)

# Create data fame: QB_df; print in console; check structure
QB_df<-data.frame(vector_character, vector_numeric, vector_logical)
QB_df
str(QB_df)

# Note: It is a good practice to add'_df" to the names of objects that are data frames.

# print the numeric column to the console; use syntax: dataframe$columnName
QB_df$vector_numeric

# print the the character column to the console; use syntax: dataframe$columnName
QB_df$vector_character

# Rename QB_df$vector_character as QB_df$qbName
names(QB_df)[names(QB_df)=="vector_character"]<-"qbName"

str(QB_df)

# Select the first row of QB_df
QB_df[1,]

# Select the first column of QB_df
QB_df[,1]

# Select the`qbName`column using ""
QB_df[,"qbName"]

# If you want to keep the complexity of the data frame, you can use the following formats.

QB_df[1]

QB_df["qbName"]

# It is important to know the difference between these approaches because we will use each for differen

# Select the cell that is at the intersection of the 3rd row and 2nd column
QB_df[3,2]

# Now it is your turn.
# Select the first row of your dataframe
QB_df[1,]

# Select the 3rd column of your dataframe
QB_df[,3]

# Select the cell that is at the intersection of the 1st row and 2nd column of your data frame
QB_df[1,2]

# What type of data structure is returned by calling names(QB_df)?
names(QB_df)
# Answer: a vector

# If we want to rename a specific element of the vector, then we need to use indexing to select the element of the vector.
names(QB_df)[names(QB_df)=="vector_numeric"]

# Now we need to assign a new value to it.
names(QB_df)[names(QB_df)=="vector_numeric"]<-"jerseyNum"

# Repeat this process for the 3rd column: HoFer (Hall of Famer)
names(QB_df)[names(QB_df)=="vector_logical"]<-"HoFer"

QB_df
